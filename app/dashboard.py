# RiskOps UI  -- With dual model predictions. 
# A fraud analyst should be able to say
# ‚ÄúThis transaction came from a new IP, outside the customer‚Äôs usual country, 
# with an unusually high amount. That does feel suspicious.‚Äù
# The UI is designed in the context of Ops person context and not in ML context
#
# They don‚Äôt need to know machine learning, but they do need to know what 
# the model is looking at ‚Äî because they:
#	Investigate alerts
#	Make judgment calls on edge cases
#	Review false positives
#	Provide feedback to improve the model
